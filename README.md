# PhilsophyWikipediaHack

> Clicking on the first lowercase link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, usually eventually gets one to the Philosophy article. As of February 2016, 97% of all articles in Wikipedia eventually lead to the article Philosophy.The remaining articles lead to an article without any outgoing wikilinks, to pages that do not exist, or get stuck in loops. This has gone up from 94.52% in 2011. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) 

Me and a teammate at Hack Princeton built a python script that takes a subject from a user and displays all the pages between the given subject and the philosophy wikipedia page.
